## CHART: cluster-install
#### Usage
- This chart must be built in the correct order to function properly as some resources within it reference others that should also be built by this chart beforehand
- bash/zsh: ```oc login <cluster-login-info> && for tpl in $(ls helm-charts/cluster-install/templates); do helm template helm-charts/cluster-install --show-only helm-charts/cluster-install/templates/$tpl | oc apply -f -; done```
- fish: ```oc login <cluster-login-info> && for tpl in (ls helm-charts/cluster-install/templates); do helm template helm-charts/cluster-install --show-only helm-charts/cluster-install/templates/$tpl | oc apply -f -; end```
